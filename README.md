Project 1- Exploring Marist College

Meghan Urban

This repository contains all of my work for my virtual tour of Marist College. This project will allow the user to visit several different locations on campus, including the Marist College Bookstore, the Dining Hall, Hancock Center, Donnelly Hall, Lowell Thomas, the Science and Allied Health Building, Tenney Stadium, McCann Center, Steel Plant Studios and Gallery, and Cannavino Library.
